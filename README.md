# ruby_parser
Example project to build a language interpreter in ruby

We are following along in part with this tutorial (https://github.com/farcaller/rly/wiki/Calculator-Tutorial-Part-1:-Basic-lexer)
However, we did diviate slightly and created a nicer REPL experiance using readline (https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/readline/rdoc/Readline.html)

To use:

    bundle install
    bundle exec ruby console.rb
